# [QuickLaunch]

> QuickLaunch is a Launcher for Android 5+ (Lollipop), licensed under GPL2+.

## PLACEHOLDER

Currently, [QuickLaunch] is at the planning/idea stage,
paper mockups exist which will be made into digital ones soon.

Aims of the project are:

+ Create a FOSS and GPL2+ launcher
+ No ads
+ Minimalism where it is possible
+ Yet, extensible and configurable.
+ Small footprint compared to feature list. Not in absolute terms, but in relative terms!
+ Performant where needed, but still readable code.
+ Be inspired by APUS, the standard Lollipop launcher, but add new features where these launchers lack.

## Requirements

+ Android 5.0+

## Installation & Building

Building will of course be based on Gradle.
Language is not yet decided on... if feasible, `groovy` will be used.

## Changelog

See **[CHANGES.md]**.
